20190,4.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,overall i have a flexible schedule my work week is monday thru friday however i work for myself and make my own hours the work environment is very calm in that i am a licensed massage therapist and yoga therapist the office is about  min from my house and is located on the second floor of a very old factory building think erector sets the toy from years and years ago! it has wooden floors and big windows that are up higher a very forgiving environment with lots of stairs and hallways i can easily have a kennel there and my clients are looking forward to meeting our new friend i plan to have enough time inbetween appointments to give the pup my complete attention which is just a matter of how i choose to book the appointments i can also have the pup at home and break up the day from morning and afternoon by being home for several hours most probably a bit of both two wednesdays a month i am away from home from until  including travel time working in a corporate setting on these  days my daughter alison has agreed to spend time with our little girl or guy joan moore also a puppy raiser has also agreed to me dropping the pup off at her house for some pup playtime i don t work on weekends the home life looks like this  female sister cats who are years old and do not go outside they have never scratched or bitten me or anyone else and are very timid although curious and friendly they are up to date on their shots and i use revolution on them even though they are inside just to be safe my partner is john terry who is an absolute lover of all animals and most importantly very well trained by me! hehehe meaning he understands that i am the main trainer for the pup and he is willing to be on the same page with me in all the activities concerning the pup we live in a small cape home  sq feet which is already animal safe because of our cats we do not have sidewalks and the road we live on is relatively busy however there are side roads which are not i am also willing to drive to where there are sidewalks to get a diversified experience i believe that we are relatively well setup for this experience i can only say relatively because it hasn t happened yet! but wherever we may be lacking we are willing to do what we need to do to improve the accommodations i am a bit nervous! it s a tremendous responsibility however i also know that i communicate better with all animals than people so i feel confident to learn the language i have had  dogs before in my life they were my best friends and will always be a part of who i am in retrospect i am surprised they were as well behaved as they were considering i knew nothing! an additional thought i would like to add is my request for a black dog i live in black leggings for my work and the maintenance of the removal of yellow hair would be something that i really would rather not have to devote time to i do hope that doesn t sound offensive in any way but if i know me this pup is going to very close to me most of the time and i plan on being hairy i also believe but perhaps not accurately that the female black labs tend to be a little smaller which given the ways in which i depend on the well being of my fingers hands and arms might make more sense for me all that being said i soooo do not wish to create criteria that puts me right out of the program so it s just my humble opinion oh and i bend crawl jump bark and roll over wait i won t bark  i hope i have created a picture that is clear and user friendly for all of us thank you for this wonderful opportunity i have already learned so very much and it s hardly begun peace

18812,13.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,the long household is a very active one with three teenage girls we live in a suburban single family two story home with a fenced in backyard and a nice park across the street typically it s a push to get everyone out by am to schools and work mom stays at home but has enjoyed some free lance work predominately in her home office school is dismissed at  so the kids return by  but different days have different kids home at different times depending on the sports season basically count on  pm being a carpool extracurricular extravaganza with some kids left at home to mind supper and do homework it is a rare night that anyone but dad is out after  dad works hard and often late julianna is a ballerina with classes t & th  pm at the school at the end of our street she is also active in her school s theater department so in the spring there will be one tech week where all hands are on deck and we don t see her until  pm she is a serious student who really looks forward to a companion to be with her and her laptop during those long study sessions katie had knee surgery this fall she no longer needs a brace and can bend her knee she will use crutches for only one to two more weeks  she has physical therapy on t th for  hour but the doctor has told her no sports this spring he has given her the green light to get a puppy  as long as it s not a big puppy already the whole prospect of raising a puppy has brightened her outlook tremendously she can walk the dog on sidewalks but won t be doing any off roading in the woods of our neighborhood park anytime soon lauren is over scheduled  especially in the winter months  she does year round swimming with practices  pm m & w is on the school basketball team with practices on th nights  and games on sunday afternoons and a few sat nights and is also on the white tail ski team which involves one parent driving her up and back on both saturdays and sundays we leave at am and get back around pm  some weekends we don t go both days  especially if it is raining and too warm the other girls don t participate in this so they will be home during this time even though lauren is the busiest schedule wise she is the youngest most affectionate and most playful  i have witnessed her taking the neighbor s dogs out for walks in the rain and i know she will be loyal beyond belief to this dog she doesn t realize this but she really does need to be older than somebody anybody! else in the house this is her opportunity to be a big sister and i know she can t wait my daughters are all very excited about doing this they were raised to be social minded and believe in giving back they just didn t realize it could be so much fun! i think there will be some over zealousness in the beginning but given the realities of our hectic schedules things will settle down they are going to cover each other when needed and divvy up the chores and pleasures of having a pet in a chart so that they can share the responsibilities and the love upon further reflection we think we would prefer to have a female dog  after all we do specialize in girls! as you know our previous geb dog was a golden so a glab would be welcome as much as a lab we know all about the hair getting everywhere so with that in mind yellow is our preference but not an absolute requirement  vacuuming is going to be an item on that chore chart! re vacations  we take two weeks off in the summer typically in august one with each set of grand parents often we do vacation rental by owner and there is a possibility of getting a dog friendly house if it is ok with geb to bring the puppy with us to the beach mountains in nc or maybe even the eastern shore we are happy to host other dogs for puppy swaps as well as when other raisers have trips planned  since the high school schedule does not match the elementary school schedule we will not be going away for spring break  instead there is a  day weekend in feb for president s day and daddy is in dire need of a vacation with his family  nothing is set in stone yet but we would like to raise a flag that we are likely to need coverage for that time i am really looking forward to being a part of the geb community again things have changed quite a bit so the girls will be on top of me as to what the current methods are and correct my old habits already i have enjoyed watching my daughters take this responsibility with such seriousness and vigor they spur each other on to do the readings to puppy proof not only their rooms but the whole house and to campaign their dad into getting the puppy in january instead of who knows when! later in the year  it has been heart warming and the dog isn t even here yet! thank you for giving the longs such happiness already

16768,5.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,i am working on a master s degree in library science online  i am taking classes full time and i am not working so that i can get through the master s program more quickly  i am not planning to get a job until i am finished with the degree  i will graduate in december or next may and will hopefully find a job in a library afterward  in my experience library jobs tend to offer fairly flexible schedules and when the time comes i don t foresee a problem with accommodating the pup s needs  for now though my schedule is almost entirely flexible i wake up in the morning anywhere between and  but i will adapt this to fit the puppy_ÔøΩÔøΩs schedule  i sleep later now because i don_ÔøΩÔøΩt have to be a certain place by a certain time but with a pup to look after this would be different  i wake up have breakfast read for a little while to give myself time to wake up and then take a shower and get ready for the day  my day is pretty simple because i spend most of my time reading textbooks writing papers and working on assignments during the day  usually i go to starbucks or the library to study for a couple of hours in the morning or afternoon one or the other  while the pup is on a schedule where he needs to go out every hour or so i plan to stay at home during the day to attend to his bathroom needs  i could study at starbucks again occasionally when the pup is old enough to stay in a crate for a few hours but i can study effectively at home so this isn_ÔøΩÔøΩt a requirement  if i don_ÔøΩÔøΩt go to starbucks to study i like to go on a walk around downtown white plains go on an errand to the grocery store or target or go to the gym downstairs  these activities each usually take about an hour michael gets home around six in the evenings and we usually have dinner between six and eight  we watch a tv show or read in the evenings and i spend time knitting or working on homework  i have class from pm on mondays and thursdays and i have to concentrate most of my attention on class during this time  michael is home by the time class starts or shortly thereafter  he can take responsibility for the puppy on those nights  once or twice a week we go out for a few hours in the evening to go to a movie or hang out with friends_ÔøΩÔøΩthis is of course flexible  on weekends we bake run errands go for walks and do chores around the house  for example we might go to a yarn store or the grocery store  sometimes we visit nyc for the day  we don_ÔøΩÔøΩt need to do this until the puppy is old enough to handle it and we could spend shorter periods of time there so as not to overwhelm him  we usually take the train but driving the car is an option too  we are both very willing to plan our activities around the puppy_ÔøΩÔøΩs needs and as you can see my schedule in particular is very flexible i left my car in atlanta and i_ÔøΩÔøΩm planning to leave it there at least until the ice and snow driving season is over  i can walk everywhere i need to go during the day the grocery store target bookstore starbucks library etc are all within easy walking distance  michael has a car and will be able to take the puppy and me where we need to go  it_ÔøΩÔøΩs also an option for me to drive him to work and use the car during the day_ÔøΩÔøΩas long as it_ÔøΩÔøΩs not snowing  the puppy will be able to get used to riding in a car we live on the sixth floor of an apartment building in white plains  i don_ÔøΩÔøΩt really know our neighbors but they_ÔøΩÔøΩre quiet  other dogs live in our building so hopefully we will pick up some tips in class about how to handle running into these dogs on our way outside  we have a one bedroom apartment  i will have time to take the dog on walks during the day so he won_ÔøΩÔøΩt be too hyper or feel cooped up inside the main thing that i wanted to talk to you about is that one of the conditions of my move to new york was that i would be able to visit my family in atlanta occasionally  i am very close to my mom so it is important to me to be able to see her  michael and i had planned for me to fly to atlanta approximately once every two months or so  since i can continue my class work there i had planned to spend about a week there at a time  it is important to me that i am able to visit with my family sometimes but i will make it a priority to plan these trips in the best interest of the puppy  michael and i have thought about options to take care of the puppy_ÔøΩÔøΩs needs in this situation  with all the dogs in our apartment building we could find a responsible dog walker to let the dog out at lunchtime if this is acceptable to guiding eyes  if not michael could come home during his lunch break if necessary  also i don_ÔøΩÔøΩt know what the guiding eyes policy is on bringing puppies on airplanes once they are old enough to handle it but if guiding eyes and the airline would allow it i_ÔøΩÔøΩd be willing to bring the dog with me so he would have experience with flying  my priority is to plan visiting around the puppy_ÔøΩÔøΩs needs finally i_ÔøΩÔøΩd like to request that we get a lab rather than a german shepherd if possible  i have allergies and allergy medicine helps enough that i am fine around labs my family_ÔøΩÔøΩs dog ivy is a lab but i don_ÔøΩÔøΩt think i would do as well with a german shepherd i tried to include everything i could think of about what my life

finished with homework during the after school care but he finishes it while mom cooks dinner pierre and i can take turns caring for the puppy until dinner on monday evening we go to our weekly puppy raiser meeting from pm to pm so we leave home at pm the puppy will come with us to these meetings then when we get home i ll take my shower first so that i can walk the puppy while my brothers take theirs raphaÔøΩÔøΩl goes to bed at pm pierre at pm i go at around pm and mom goes soon after us unless she has work to do  she is currently translating a book for a french author so sometimes she works on it while everyone sleeps  puppy will go to bed at pm when i take it to its crate for the night on tuesday evenings we don t do anything so we can be home with the puppy during baseball seasons pierre and raphaÔøΩÔøΩl usually have games or practices on that night but i stay home and can care for the puppy on wednesday evenings raphaÔøΩÔøΩl and i go fencing at virginia wesleyan college from pm to pm mom takes us there and stays there at the food court while we practice she will be taking the puppy with us so that she can walk and work with it outside in the parking lot while we practice fencing on thursday evenings mom has a photography club meeting from pm to pm that she goes to on the st and rd thursday of each month on weeks that she doesn t have the meeting she stays with us at home on fridays i do fencing with my school s club at bishop sullivan so mom comes with my brothers to pick me up there on fridays mom works until noon only and she is free in the afternoons so she ll be home caring for the puppy and taking it with her to get my brothers then they ll come to pick me up after fencing usually she stays in the parking lot and watches us practice outside the puppy will be able to watch us too on saturday mornings mom teaches a french class at odu in norfolk but she gets home by pm i will be home to care for the puppy while she teaches on the st and the rd saturday of the month pierre raphaÔøΩÔøΩl and i have altar boys practice at church from  am to noon so on these days puppy will go to odu in the classroom with mom puppy will do whatever we are doing on saturday afternoons mom usually tries once a month to take us somewhere like in greenville sc to go to walk in the mountains   on sundays we go to mass church from am to noon the puppy will stay home church is also less than  miles from home so mom asked father if we could bring the puppy to church once it is old enough to behave father is all right with it so the first few months puppy will stay home while we go to church but once it starts behaving well enough we ll start taking it to church with us sunday afternoon raphaÔøΩÔøΩl and i go to a pokemon cards club for the first few months puppy will stay with mom at home or wherever she goes when she takes her long walks outside  then later on i plan on taking the puppy with me there when he can stay a couple of hours in one spot behaving  on sunday afternoons pierre is always outside playing football with his friends so mom may take it to watch the boys play
